1)
    Server IP: 131.212.41.127
    Server Port: 22 (since I used scp/ssh)

2)
    Client IP: 131.212.128.194
    Client Port: 65089

3)
    After the 3-way handshake:
    Packet No. where the server received the file request via TCP is: Frame 60
    Packet No. where the server begins sending the file via SSHv2 is: Frame 61

    Not entirely sure what this question is asking, or perhaps its something I'm
    not seeing in wireshark since I used SCP/SSH, but each encrypted packet entry
    that the server sent showed a length of 1448

    I'm not entirely sure on this question.  I applied the filter: 
    'tcp.analysis.retransmission' which left no results in the wireshark window.
    But while looking through the trace I noticed several instances of ACK signals
    being sent from client to server for the same SEQ number, which the way I
    understood that to mean - was that the server would see a duplicate acknowledgment
    and retransmit that block of packets.
